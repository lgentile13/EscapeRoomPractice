    <h2 id='description'>Description</h2>
    
    <p>My fellow trustee....you have been selected to travel back to the Roaring 20's, a time of partying, fun, and Intolerance. There is a mission I need you to complete for me. Mr. and Mrs. Albrecht have donated millions to Long Island and its reformations and they are highly valued. Someone has recently stolen and hidden Mrs. Clara Albrecht's ten million dollar daimond necklace from her home. This necklace is a family heirloom and it's absence has made Mrs. Albrecht tremendously distressed. We are aware that the necklace has been hidden somewhere in the 80 acre Warren Bamford Mansion. Tonight there will be party at this mansion which is located at the tip of Long Island near the Montauk Lighthouse. I will need you to attend this gathering and stay under the radar. Mr. and Mrs. Albrecht will take part in this festivity along side vast amounts of security. I will need you to find clues to where this necklace could be. Think you could help me find it without getting caught?</p>
    
    <p> The time is 1920... It's around 7:00 P.M. on August 10. The sun is resting on the water slowly going down as the moon awakens. You hear the car doors shutting as people are arriving, the loud chatter and laughter of people mingling, and the alluring music that gets louder and louder as you enter the lively party.  </p>
