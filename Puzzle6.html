   <h1> You found out where the coins drown, congrats. Pretty clever huh... anyways you seem to be getting closer, but youre not quite there yet soldier. So heres the situation, last week Mrs. Albretch went out of town at 9:00 AM alongside her sister Marie. She returned on August 4th when she realized her necklace went missing. Mr. Albretch had sent out a search team to look for the necklace but they had no luck. They decided to ask her sister if she knew what had happened to it. She stated she saw 5 men running away from the house and they were dressed in black. "They were holding a safe", stated Marie. </p>
     
     <Br>
       <p> We have secured the safe but do you think you can crack the code?</p>
